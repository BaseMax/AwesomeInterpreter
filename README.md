SPIKE was specifically designed to focus on finding exploitable bugs, so it’s an excellent choice for our purposes.  SPIKE also includes a simple scripting capability, and within the SPIKE distribution, there are a few command line tools which can act as interpreters to simple text files containing SPIKE primitives.

- [mujs](https://github.com/jarhot1992/mujs)
MuJS is a lightweight Javascript interpreter designed for embedding in other software to extend them with scripting capabilities. It is written in portable C and implements ECMAScript as specified by ECMA-262.  Why? Because V8, SpiderMonkey and JavaScriptCore are all too big and complex. MuJS's focus is on small size, correctness and simplicity.  The interface for binding with native code is designed to be as simple as possible to use, and is similar to Lua. There is no need for interacting with byzantine C++ template mechanisms, or worry about marking and unmarking garbage collection roots, or wrestle with obscure build systems.

- [Micro-shell--ush-](https://github.com/ankscircle/Micro-shell--ush-)
"ush" is a command interpreter written in C with a syntax similar to UNIX C shell. The main tasks were- Lexical structure formation and implementation, command line parsing, pipe- lining of commands & their parallel execution, I/O redirection, command execution, environment variables, signal handling & creating built-in commands.

- [LuaThread](https://github.com/aknorjaden/LuaThread)
LuaThread is a double layer wrapper for the Lua script language interpreter and also uses Tomaka17's luawrapper (link below) below the bottom layer for quick development.  The top class can either create a new thread inside of which the lower layer class is instantiated or no threading can be used.  The intention is to use this component with the evemuproject's evemu_server for NPC AI and other scriptable features.
